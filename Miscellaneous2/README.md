The files contained in this folder represent a basic structure of any application that records patients and determines whether or not they have an appointment. The patient class consists of a first name, last name, and an
appointment class. The appointment class consists of important information about the appointment, such as location, local date, local time, time period(AM or PM), and a boolean value that determines whether an appointment is
scheduled or not. This package utilized the java.time API, specifically using the imported classes LocalDate, LocalTime, and LocalDateTime.
