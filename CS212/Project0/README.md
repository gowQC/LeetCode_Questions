My introductory assignment for object-oriented programming in Java. The program is very simple: using JOptionPane, this program asks for user input via a JOptionPane and takes the input to record how many E's and e's are
found within the provided string. The program loops until closed by the user. If the program is closed via the cancel button or the x button, NullPointerException is caught and closes without error.
