My first major project for object-oriented programming in Java. Given a .txt file with each line of text being any three numbers formatted as follows (3, 5, 8), this program takes each line and records the
information found as measurements for boxes. The program will treat each numeric value as a representation of lenghth, width, and height for a unique box per line respectively. When the user inputs the
name of a suitable file, the program will not only display the .txt contents in a JFrame window, but it will also calculate the volume of each box as well as. The JFrame window is split into two pannels:
the pannel on the left details the boxes recorded in order of however they were retrieved, and the pannel on the right displays the total volumes recorded in order from least to greatest. Invalid text or
unknown file names will trigger an exception that is caught.
